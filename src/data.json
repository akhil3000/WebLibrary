Interviewers want candidates to exhibit their technical knowledge of core building blocks and the rationale of their design approach. This course presents carefully selected system design problems with detailed solutions that will enable you to handle complex scalability scenarios during an interview or designing new products. \n\nYou will start with learning a bottom-up approach to designing scalable systems. First, you’ll learn about the building blocks of modern systems, with each component being a completely scalable application in itself. You'll then explore the RESHADED framework for architecting web-scale applications by determining requirements, constraints, and assumptions before diving into a step-by-step design process. Finally, you'll design several popular services by using these modular building blocks in unique combinations, and learn how to evaluate your design.",

This course has hand-picked seminal work in system design that has stood the test of time and is grounded on strong principles. You will learn all these principles and see them in action in real-world systems.\n\nAfter taking this course, you will be able to solve various system design interview problems. You will have a deeper knowledge of an outage of your favorite app and will be able to understand their event post-mortem reports. This course will set your system design standards so that you can emulate similar success in your endeavors.",

By employing advanced tools and techniques, data scientists delve into the depths of data to uncover answers to critical questions such as what happened, why it happened, what will happen next, and what actions can be taken based on the findings.\n\nIn today's digital age, data science plays a pivotal role in deciphering the ever-increasing volume of data generated by modern organizations. From e-commerce transactions to medical records and financial transactions, data permeates every aspect of human life. This abundance of data presents both challenges and opportunities for businesses seeking to derive actionable insights to drive decision-making processes.\n\n![](/static/ML_AI_DL_Relationship.webp)\n\n## Prerequisites for Learning Data Science\n1. Knowledge Of Any Object Oriented Language with DSA skill\n2. Knowledge of 12th Class Mathematics like Linear Algebra, Statistics, Calculus.\n3. Problem Solving Skill & Analytical Thinking\n4. Knowledge of CS Fundmentals is Must and Should\n5. Web Application Knoweldge is Not Mandatory But Good To have"

Turing was recruited, along with a few other mathematicians, into the code-breaking effort undertaken by the British government at Bletchley Park to crack the Enigma machine. The Enigma was a sophisticated electro-mechanical device used by the German military to encrypt their orders, including those transmitted to the U-boats wreaking havoc on the Atlantic shipping lanes. The “keys” - the sets of rules for encoding messages - used by the Enigma would change constantly. Turing designed machines, known as “bombes”, that could cycle through hundreds and thousands of Enigma settings to match the available “cribs” (the most frequently occurring words across messages) to identify the correct key. It was extremely difficult work, tense and taut, equal parts educated guesswork and puzzle solving. Turing's contributions helped make the decryption work at Bletchley Park a success and played a substantial role in the eventual victory of the Allies over Axis Powers, leading to the foundation of Computer Science after the war. You can learn more about this invention in the documentary film called The Imitation Game. You can learn about this theoretically from a subject called Theory Of Computation in more detail.\n\n ## Early Age Computers \n ![](/static/EarlyComputers.jpg)\n\n- The Early Age Computers are Very large in Size, The cost of Memory and Processor is also high\n- Early Age Computers are mainly used for Scientific and Industrial Purpose.\n\n ## Modern Day Computers\n\n ![](/static/mac.jpg)\n\nIn 1984 Apple Company released 1st version of Personal computer Macintosh,Modern day Computers,Laptops evolved from this Machine Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniac together developed this,So that Common man can use it for personal purpose.\n\n ## Programming a Computer\n\nThere are a plethora of languages that the programmer uses for giving commands to the computer. All these languages are categorized as assembly-level language, machine-level language, and high-level language. Languages like C, C++, Python, and Java are high-level programming languages. Machine-level language is a low-level language that deals with 0s and 1s, Whereas assembly-level language lies between low-level language and high-level language; it is more of an intermediary language.\n\n ## How to Become Programmer in Nowadays\n\n\n- Learn a Procedural Programming Language\n- Learn a Object Oriented Programming Language with Data Structures And Algorithms\n- Learn Computer Sciene Fundamentals\n- Choose a Specailization Either Web Development or Data Science or Your Intrested Domain and Make Projects\n- You can learn all these skills and concepts from the guidence provided by this blog\n- What you need is Dedication to learn,Internet Connection,Laptop"

Interviewers want candidates to exhibit their technical knowledge of core building blocks and the rationale of their design approach. This course presents carefully selected system design problems with detailed solutions that will enable you to handle complex scalability scenarios during an interview or designing new products. \n\nYou will start with learning a bottom-up approach to designing scalable systems. First, you’ll learn about the building blocks of modern systems, with each component being a completely scalable application in itself. You'll then explore the RESHADED framework for architecting web-scale applications by determining requirements, constraints, and assumptions before diving into a step-by-step design process. Finally, you'll design several popular services by using these modular building blocks in unique combinations, and learn how to evaluate your design.",
